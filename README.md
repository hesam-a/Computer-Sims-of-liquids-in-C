This repository includes some C++ version (written by H.A) of some programs from the book "Computer simulations of liquids"
by Allen and Tildesley

The program math_module that includes a header file as well, will be completed based on the written programs, not following the orginal
math module of the book. So far it is written for the t_tensor program that is used to calculate the electrostatic interactions between 
two linear molecules including dipole-dipole, dipole-quadrupole and quadrupole-quadrupole, using T tensors and Euler angles.
